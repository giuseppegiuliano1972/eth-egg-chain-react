### EggChain

EggChain is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enhance transparency and traceability in the egg supply chain from farm to consumer. It enables easy verification of egg origin, freshness, and quality. The DApp uses blockchain's distributed ledger for reliable record-keeping and addresses common traceability issues in food supply chains. EggChain uses a public, permissioned blockchain and the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) for efficient data storage, maintaining data integrity through role-based access. Despite facing challenges in its current implementation, future developments in EggChain aim to adopt a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism and enhance product traceability, offering an echo friendly and fast solution in the egg industry's supply chain management.

The DApp was made to pass the exam of "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies" for the computer science master's degree at "La Sapienza" - University of Rome.
The course overall was very interesting and gave us an insight into the technologies used to develop blockchain-based DApps.
